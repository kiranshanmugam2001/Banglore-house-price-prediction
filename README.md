This data science project shows you the step by step approach to build a machine learning model using linear regression, lasso regression, decision tree and random forest regression. The prices of bagalore houses are downloaded from kaggle. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,

Python
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
Matplotlib for data visualization
